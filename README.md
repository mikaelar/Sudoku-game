# **Sudoku-game**
## Sudoku game with three levels of difficulty.
### ***Rules of the game:***
-each row should contain the numbers between 1 and 9 exactly **1** time
-each column should contain the numbers between 1 and 9 exactly **1** time
-if we separate the sudoku in 9 squares(3x3), each of them should contain the numbers between 1 and 9 exactly **1** time
### ***Start of the game***
When you start the game you will see instructions for playing: for choosing the level of difficulty and your sudoku.
### ***Notice:***
The numeration of the rows and columns( that you have to give as input data every time until you solve the sudoku) starts with 0 and ends with 8.
*Example: if you want to insert a number on 1st row and 2st position you have to write 0 (for row) and 1 (for column).*
If you insert a number, that is already in the row/column/square, you will be given a new opportunity to insert another input data.
If you think some of the numbers, you inserted are *NOT* on their correct position, you can insert 0 on this position and when you push *Enter*, this position will be empty for your new choice.
